    <h2> Summary </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I am a data scientist and academic with over 20 years of experience. My research emphasizes using big data and advanced statistical modeling for data exploration, visualization, hypothesis testing, and forecasting multiple phenomena in natural and social sciences. I have extensively used R libraries and custom scripts for my research. I have recently increased my analytical capabilities with SQL and Python. This work requires coordinating a large group of collaborators and assistants, including many graduate and postgraduate students. I took action to make this research relevant to the scientific community through a strong publication record, as well as to non-technical decision-makers and the general public through workshops, working groups, talks, and appearances on social media. </p>
